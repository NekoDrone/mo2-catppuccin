# MO2 Catppuccin

A Catppuccin theme for the modding tool Mod Organizer 2

## Installation

1. Download your preferred flavour from the Releases tab, or from the blob. (Currently only Mocha)
2. Place the file in the `%MO2_DIR%\stylesheets\` directory. You can also access this directory by heading to the "Configure settings and workarounds" button on MO2, under the Themes tab, click "Explore..." and place the file in that folder.
3. Select `catppuccin_mocha` from the dropdown. You might need to give MO2 a quick reboot.
